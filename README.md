# Hey, yall! <br> I'm Arham Aneeq. 

I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Metallurgical Engineering and Material Sciences from IIT Indore. I'm interested in pursuing computational methods in material science; and I'm passionate about Quantum Computing and Data Science, and how these techniques can be utilised to supplement, and be supplemented by my core engineering speciality.

I got started with programming all the way back in 2018, with, like many others, web tech. I learnt JS, JQuery, Angular, and PHP, slowly expanding to bona fide programming languages like Java. It's been a long time since then. I'm into the weird of programming, having learnt APL before Python, I've a bad habit of jamming in lambdas wherever possible. But don't worry, with 7 years of experience debugging, I know how to write clean code for sanity's sake, if nothing else.

I’m fascinated by how numerical and algorithmic approaches can help decode the physical world. Whether it's running simulations rooted in Density Functional Theory, using machine learning for materials characterization, or exploring quantum algorithms to model complex systems: I’m here for the math, the models, and the mess.
